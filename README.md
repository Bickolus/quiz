# Assignment 04: Code Quiz

## My Task

This assignment objective is simple. Create a quiz on JavaScript using JavaScript and Web API.
I do not have to worry about styling, hence why there is not much CSS used here. However,
the quiz does need:

1. A timer that ends the quiz if it reaches zero. 
2. A start button that presents the user with a question
3. When the user answers the question, another one should appear
4. The quiz is over if the user finishes all questions and/or the score is 0
5. The user can save their initials along with their score
6. If the user loads the website again, it should display the previous scores

The objective is simple, but implementing the quiz was somewhat challenging. There were so many
times where the buttons did not iterate and appear properly, or the "correct!" and "incorrect!" 
text kept showing even after resetting the quiz. The JavaScript code is not the cleanest or
maybe the most efficient, I admit. However, I have tested every use case and it works without problems.
